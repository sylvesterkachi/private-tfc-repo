# Multiple Amazon EventBridge Buses to Multiple Amazon SNS Topics

The AWS SAM template deploys three EventBridge Buses, six EventBridge Rules (2 per Bus),  four SNS 
Topics, three SQS queues and a Lambda function.  The lambda function is an event generator which 
sends events to EventBridge Buses that trigger appropriate Rules sending the payload to the 
appropriate SNS Topic.  SQS queues are attached to the Rules as Dead Letter Queues. Appropriate 
permissions are granted to EventBridge to trigger the SNS Topics and the Lambda function to put 
events in the EventBridge.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if 
you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions 
to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and 
configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application 
Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) 
(AWS SAM) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd _patterns-model
    ```
1. From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in 
the template.yml file:
    ```
    sam deploy --guided
    ```
1. During the prompts:
    * Enter a stack name
    * Enter the desired AWS Region
    * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.

    Once you have run `sam deploy --guided` mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file 
(samconfig.toml), you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaults.

1. Note the outputs from the SAM deployment process. These contain the resource names and/or ARNs 
which are used for testing.

## How it works

To make this easier to understand, we use an example.  Countries report cross-border transactions to 
their respective Reserve/Central Bank.  For simplicity, transactions originate from bank branches or 
ATM (automatic teller machines) as sub-domains (source) from all banks.  For simplicity we use three 
EventBridge Buses - (bluebank, redbank and greenbank).  The "DetailType" is filtering for 
"transaction type" and the "Detail" section filters the "Yes/No" reportable field.  Based on these 
combinations, events trigger different Rules and send transaction payloads to SNS Topics of the 
ReserveBank and/or the Transaction Warehouses of the respective bank's SNS Topics.  The accompanying 
Lambda function will put events on the Buses to demonstrate this pattern.

## Testing

1. From the output, get the 4 SNS Topic ARNs and subscribe 4 email addresses to the SNS Topics using 
this command structure.

aws sns subscribe --topic-arn ENTER_YOUR_TOPIC_ARN --protocol email --notification-endpoint 
ENTER_YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS

2. Click the confirmation link delivered to your emails to verify the endpoint.

3. Send an event to EventBridge using the Lambda function:
- Get the 3 ARNs of the EventBridge Buses from the Output.
- Open the Lambda function code in your Lambda console and replace "bus_a", "bus_b" and "bus_c" with 
the ARNs of the Buses created the SAM template.
- Deploy the function and "Test" on the Console
- Alternatively, get the function name from the Cloud Formation Output and use the following CLI 
command to invoke the function a few times:

`aws lambda invoke --function-name myfunction response.json`

4. The function will randomly choose any of the 3 Buses and send an event.  The events will be 
classified "reportable" or "non-reportable".  All "reportable" events trigger notification with the 
payload to the "ReserveBank SNS Topic" and another notification to the appropriate Bank Warehouse 
matching the Bus selected.  All "non-reportable" events do not trigger the ReserveBank SNS Topic but 
trigger the respective Bank Warehouse matching the Bus selected.

Consider this test successful if the email address subscribed to the "ReserveBank SNS Topic" 
receives all notifications for all "reportable" transactions regardless of the Source/Bank.  
Secondly, if all bank Warehouse Topics receive their respective notifications for transactions from 
events triggered by Rules based on prescribed patterns from their Sources (ATM/Bank Branch).  

## Cleanup

1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name STACK_NAME
    ```
1. Confirm the stack has been deleted
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation list-stacks --query 
"StackSummaries[?contains(StackName,'STACK_NAME')].StackStatus"
    ```
